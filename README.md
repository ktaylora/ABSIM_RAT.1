# ABSIM_RAT.1

ABSIM_RAT.1 is an agent-based model of landscape change that uses a 'rational' long-term profit-seeking decision-optimization strategy to simulate aggregate land owner decisions in a target geography -- typically at the scale of a US county. ABSIM_RAT.1 can be thought of as a rational choice model (from rational choice theory, e.g., Scott, 2000) that is intended to be used as a comparison against alternative (behavioral) models of landscape change. The assumption is that ABSIM_RAT's predictions will generally approximate the average aggregate predictions of behavioral model simulations of change across a landscape, except in those circumstance where Rational Choice theory fails to adequately represent producer decisions.
