# ABSIM_RAT.1

A (not) agent-based model of landscape change that uses a 'rational', long-term profit-seeking decision optimization strategy to simulate aggregate land owner decisions in a target geography (typically at the scale of a US county). ABSIM_RAT can be thought of as a traditional rational choice model (from Rational choice theory, e.g., Scott, 2000) that is intended to be used in a comparison against alternative (agent-based) models of landscape change. The assumption is that ABSIM_RAT's predictions will generally approximate the average aggregate predictions of agent-based simulations of change across a landscape, except in those circumstance where RE theory fails to adequately represent producer decisions.
